# WipProtect
:eyes: Protect your new october instance from perky eyes before launch date.

When sharing your WIP with your client, you want only your client to be able to
view your work.
You could offcourse put you OctoberCMS in Maintenance mode and create a user account
for you client; And email him or her the credentials and userguide.

:confused: *A little bit cumbersome, isn't it?*

What if you could just email your client the link and a 6-digit code?

This Plugin does exactly that!

In the  backend of OctoberCMS you easily enable the plugin, enter a code and hit save. From now on the whole frontend is hidden behind the  security :key: code!

## Security
This plugin is not meant as a proper authentication system. Don't use it as such.

No seriously.

If you discover any security-related issues, please email support@vannut.nl instead of using the issue tracker.
